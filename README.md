# Birth and Child Mortality in SADC countries
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) is an inter-governmental organisation of Southern and East African territories headquartered in Gaberone, Botswana. As birth rates and child mortality rates worldwide have been decreasing since 1950, I hypothesised that the trends are similar for the SADC member countries. 

## Installation
The code requires Python versions of 3.* and general libraries available through the Anaconda package. In addition, the data visualisation software Tableau Public (versions 2021.3) needs to be installed

## Project Motivation
I used this project as a way to practice my data cleaning and data visualisation skills. I used Anaconda and Tableau software for cleaning and visualisation respectively. 
World-wide, birth rates and child mortality rates have been on the decline, I wanted to find out if this same trend is being observed in sub-saharan Africa, specifically in SADC member countries. This region (Sub-Saharan Africa) currently has contributes more than half of all under-five deaths, despite only having 26% of the total under-5 population.

## File description
There are two files of relavance, Jupyter notebook `Birth-and-Child-Mortality-SADC` and the .csv file for use in Tableau Public software `sadc-cleaned.csv`.
- The data visualisation is available [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/panashe4489/viz/Birth-and-Child-Mortality-SADC/Births).
